This playable portfolio is designed for desktop browsers and may not function correctly on mobile devices.

### 📄 Prefer a Traditional Resume?  
You can click the "Resume" button in the main menu to view a professional, paper-style resume instead.

### 🛠️ Work in Progress  
This portfolio is an ongoing project, and I’ll continue expanding the game world over time.  
The Settings tab is currently non-functional, and you may encounter minor glitches during gameplay. Thanks for your patience!
